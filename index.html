    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>The best thing that helped me understand all the concepts were the PowerPoint slideshows, which included many definitions and examples of usage.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>I think the course is good enough without a change unless more modern techniques are available to practice.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
    <p>I understood what I expected to learn in the course, however, Bootstrap can be pretty complex and confusing at first.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>I knew most of the concepts, although much of it was explained better this time around.</p>
